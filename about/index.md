I like to write code to solve problems. Currently most of my work consists of basic front-end development, but I also have some knowledge 
in the backend using PHP or Python. My goal is to eventually become a full stack developer using focused on using the [**MEAN**](http://mean.io) stack.

In my free time I like to build computers, read about new and emerging technologies, and climb rocks to really high places.
