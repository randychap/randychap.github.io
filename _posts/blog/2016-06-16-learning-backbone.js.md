I decided it was about time I learn my first MV* JavaScript framework to help with front-end development and build 
better and more robust web applications. I've heard of many several of these MV* frameworks but the ones that stuck 
out to me the most were Angular, Knockout, Ember, React, and of course Backbone.

### What is MV*? ###
It is a design pattern that many of these JavaScript frameworks try to follow. Traditionally the pattern has been MVC or
Model, View, and Controller. However, these MV* frameworks have alternate models such as [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) (Model, View, Presenter), or [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (Model, View, View, Model) pattern.

### Why I choose Backbone as my first MV* Framework ###
Although I wanted a way to program my JavaScript in a more organized manner, one reason why I chose Backbone as my first
is because it's been around for awhile so I figured it would be easier to learn. Later more robust frameworks such as 
Angular and Ember came out which I figured I would get into later once I had learned about Backbone. 

#### conclusion ####
Well I guess that's all for now. This blogging thing is pretty new to me but I'll try to write a post once a day or so.
So until next time.

Cheers!
